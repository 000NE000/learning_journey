    - How to access and modify two-dimensional list elements
2. functions, method related with lists
    - Add elements to a list by index using the insert method.
    - Remove elements from a list by index using the `.pop()`method.
    - Generate a list using the `range()` function.
    - Get the length of a list using the `len()` function.
    - Select portions of a list using slicing syntax. [N:M]
    - Count the number of times that an element appears in a list using the` .count()` method.
    - Sort a list of items using either the `.sort()` method or `sorted()` function.
3. tuples
4. function `zip()`
    - make list whose elment is tuple in which first list element and corresponding ordered element of second list are combined

#### functions

    - What problems arise in our programs without functions
    - What functions are and how to write them
    - How whitespace plays an important role in how a program will execute our code and more importantly distinguish function code from non-function code
    - How to pass input values into our functions using parameters and arguments
    - The difference between built-in and user-defined functions and some common built-in functions python offers
    - How we can reuse function output with the return keyword, as well as multiple returns.
    - Where variables can be accessed in our programs that use functions

    - [lambda fuction]

    - [high order function]
        - map
        - filter
        - sorted
#### strings

    - A string is a list of characters.
    - A character can be selected from a string using its index string_name[index]. These indices start at 0.
    - A ‘slice’ can be selected from a string. These can be between two indices or can be open-ended, selecting all of the string from a point.
    - Strings can be concatenated to make larger strings.
    - len() can be used to determine the number of characters in a string.
    - Strings can be iterated through using for loops
    - Iterating through strings opens up a huge potential for applications, especially when combined with conditional statements.

    - `.upper()`, `.title()`, and `.lower()` adjust the casing of your string.
    - `.split()` takes a string and creates a list of substrings.
    - `.join()` takes a list of strings and creates a string.
    - `.strip()` cleans off whitespace, or other noise from the beginning and end of a string.
    - `.replace()` replaces all instances of a character/string in a string with another character/string.
    - `.find()` searches a string for a character/string and returns the index value that character/string is found at.
    - `.format()` allows you to interpolate a string with variables

#### modules

    - what modules are and how they can be useful
    - how to use a few of the most commonly used Python libraries
    - what namespaces are and how to avoid polluting your local namespace
    - how scope works for file in Python

#### dictionary
- How to create a dictionary
- How to add elements to a dictionary
- How to update elements in a dictionary
- How to use a dict comprehension to create a dictionary from two lists
- Use a key to get a value from a dictionary
- Check for existence of keys : `.get()`
- Remove a key: value pair from a dictionary : `.pop()`
- Iterate through keys and values in dictionaries : `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
